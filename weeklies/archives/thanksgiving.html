              This is a day after, the event. My school had a thanksgiving assembly and had dignatories from other branches of our school. For some background history, I have been active in co-curricular activities in the past but have been on a undefined hiatus. For obvious reasons, being active in that part of the school means more clout, respect and confidence. Even if you were an active member in the past, if you don't constantly sacrifice time and sanity in these things, your respect and clout just doesn't stays the same. I have been the best the school has to offer in the past. <br> This Thanksgiving assmebly is a statment from me. A statment of confidence. It don't matter the length of my hiatus, I will always be the best. This assembly is a declaration that I  can plug right back into the system and still be the best. During my break, other newbies have taken place but this assembly is a testimony of the greatest.
