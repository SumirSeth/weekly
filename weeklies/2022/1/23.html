              <u>Previous Week.</u>
          </p>
          <p>Pinocchio, as a concept is better than humans. Atleast, it shows when it lies, unlike most humans.<br>Been a pretty good week. I've been exploring ideas of side income, no pressure but it feels wrong asking parents for money. This week I discovered this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)">'grit'</a> it's a personality trait and is based on the idea of perseverance. If you have this trait, I am jealous.<br>Highlights-</p>

          <p>One of the better weeks I have been through.</p>

              <u>Comparison.</u>
          </p>
          <p><a href=16.html>Last week's weekly</a> for comparison.<br>I was able to complete most of my goals. Only thing that's been bothering me is I haven't started a book yet. Maybe PDF's ain't the way to go. One of my friends on discord said, being busy is proportional to how happy you feel. This has really stuck with me, thanks Mo.</p>

                <u>For the next week.</u>
          </p>
          <p>Most importantly I would like to maintain consistency. Other things include:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote border border-3 border-white">
              <ul>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Improving grit.</li>
                      <li>Expand study hours (6+).</li>
                      <li>Explore career paths.</li>
                      <li>Start preparation for coaching enrollment.</li>
                      <li>Focus on health.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
